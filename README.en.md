# TokenTracker ZzH

**This is my own custom-tuned build of [xiufengsun/TokenTracker](https://github.com/xiufengsun/TokenTracker)** — the same tracker with my own changes on top: the backend switched to my own server, ZzH as the default desktop pet, no OAuth, and its own deep-link scheme, port and icon so it can sit next to the original without either build hijacking the other.

### Track every AI token — then bring your usage to life

An accurate, local-first token usage and cost dashboard for **39 AI coding tools** — plus a desktop pet, native widgets, and cloud sync backed by my own server instead of the original project's.

## What this fork changes

Upstream is a finished product; this is my personal build of it. Everything below is the delta.

| | Change |
|---|---|
| ☁️ **My backend** | Sync, the cross-device account view and the leaderboard talk to my own server instead of the original project's hosted one — including the CLI's default backend URL, which used to point at upstream's. |
| 🔑 **No OAuth** | The login page is email + password only. All OAuth provider slots are empty on the server, and the provider buttons are gone from the UI rather than left in place to fail at click time. |
| 🐾 **ZzH** | A pink-on-white "Z" mark and a new default desktop pet (a v2 sprite atlas) replace upstream's black bolt and Clawd mascot in the tray, the taskbar, the favicon and the dashboard. |
| 🔗 **No scheme/port clash** | `ttzzh://` instead of `tokentracker://`, CLI port **17890** instead of 7680, and its own installer identity — so clicking "open in app" on upstream's website launches *their* app, never this one. |
| 🧩 **Several accounts per adapter** | The Limits page can track more than one login per provider, each with its own key and plan. See below. |
| 💰 **Pinned model prices** | DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (and its aliases) are priced at the V4 Flash rates instead of $0, including the time-of-use discount. |
| 📉 **Two cost bugs fixed** | The detail modal used to bill every DeepSeek token at the peak rate (~1.7× the dashboard headline) because it priced model aggregates instead of rows. |
| 🐟 **DeepSeek Harness counted on its own** | Upstream folded `dsh` into "Other" — the leaderboard gives it a column with its icon, the profile modal lists it as its own provider, and the **sessions view** discovers it behind its own filter. |
| 🤖 **AstrBot tracked separately** | Finds AstrBot's database on its own — launcher instances, `ASTRBOT_ROOT`, the desktop build, `~/.astrbot` — so every call's tokens, model and conversation are counted under its own leaderboard column (with the official mark) instead of falling into "Other". Sessions are listed too. Point an environment variable at it when the path is custom or it runs in a container. |
| 🎮 **OpenBitFun tracked separately** | Finds its data directory on its own (`~/.openbitfun`) and counts every call's tokens, model and conversation under its own leaderboard column (with the official mark); sessions are listed too. Note: its records carry **no cached-token split**, so cache hits are billed as fresh input and cost reads high. Point `TOKENTRACKER_OPENBITFUN_DIR` at it when the path is unusual. |
| 🅦 **wcode tracked separately** | Finds its data directory on its own (`~/.wcode`, or point `WCODE_HOME` at it), counting every call's tokens, model and session separately, with its own leaderboard column (with icon) and session-browser support. It keeps two usage generations — the older `message` table and the newer `model_usage` table — merged per session, so neither the migrated history nor the older one is double-counted or lost. |
| 🔄 **One-shot full upload on login** | After switching account or backend, the first sync sends the **entire** local queue in one go instead of crawling 1000 rows every 15 minutes; increments follow. |
| 🖼️ **Avatar from an image URL** | No OAuth means no provider avatar, so you paste an image link in Settings and the header, sidebar and leaderboard all use it. The link is cached: reloads are instant, and saving a new one swaps it immediately. |
| 🧹 **Clear the local cache** | Settings → Account has a one-click clear for cached leaderboard periods, community stats and prefetched data; it reloads afterwards. |

## The three achievements this fork adds

All three are earned by **tokens spent on those models** — bronze 1 Token, silver 100M, gold 1B, diamond 10B — recomputed hourly.

### Oracle

<img src="./docs/screenshots/zzh-badge-oracle.png" alt="Oracle" width="150" align="right" />

**Unlocks by spending Tokens on GPT-6 Astra.**

> You burn API invoices as incense and prompts as prayers, asking the god in the cloud. It answers in tokens, and you pay in balance. Every call is an expensive summoning; every reply is the god signing your bill.

<br clear="right" />

### Mortal Frame, Rival to Gods

<img src="./docs/screenshots/zzh-badge-mortal-frame.png" alt="Mortal Frame, Rival to Gods" width="150" align="right" />

**Unlocks by spending Tokens on any DeepSeek model.**

> They say the gods sit above and mortals crawl below, that wisdom carries a price tag and common folk deserve only a perfunctory echo. You tried anyway — and the one with no divine name simply opened its eyes and handed the answer back. Not lofty, but earnest; no thunder, just a lamp lit.


### The Root of All Evil

<img src="./docs/screenshots/zzh-badge-root-of-all-evil.png" alt="The Root of All Evil" width="150" align="right" />

**Unlocks by spending Tokens on the GPT-3.5 series.**

> Before the dawn of the compute era it arrived quietly — no thunder, no oracle, just a gentle hello. That greeting tore the hardware market off its axis: it lit the spark under graphics cards, woke the memory frenzy, and burned solid-state drives to ash in the blaze of demand.

## Several accounts per adapter

TokenTracker tracked exactly one account per provider — whatever the local CLI happened to be logged into. That is not enough when you keep a work login and a personal one, or two API keys with different plans.

Add accounts to `~/.tokentracker/tracker/config.json`:

```json
{
  "limits": {
    "accounts": [
      { "id": "commandcode-goat", "provider": "commandCode",
        "label": "CommandCode GOAT", "plan": "GOAT", "apiKey": "user_..." },
      { "id": "commandcode-go", "provider": "commandCode",
        "label": "CommandCode Go", "plan": "Go", "apiKey": "user_..." },
      { "id": "kimi-work", "provider": "kimi",
        "label": "Kimi (work)", "plan": "Moonshot", "apiKey": "sk-..." },
      { "id": "codex-alt", "provider": "codex",
        "label": "Codex (second account)", "home": "~/.codex-work" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each entry becomes its own card — its own label, its own plan badge, its own quota windows and reset times. Two credential modes, because the adapters do not all work the same way:

- **`apiKey`** — the adapter's quota API accepts an explicit key. Supported for **kimi**, **opencodeGo** and **commandCode**; the key replaces the local CLI lookup entirely.
- **`home`** — the adapter authenticates with a local CLI session, so a second account means a second profile directory. Log in there with the provider's own variable (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `GEMINI_HOME`, `KIMI_HOME`) and point the account at it.

An adapter that can address neither reports *"this adapter reads its quota from the local CLI login"* rather than silently showing the built-in account's numbers under a second label. ZCode is deliberately one of those: its endpoint and plan kind can only be derived from the local install.

## Install and run

Requires **Node.js ≥ 20**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WONGIII/TokenTrackerZzH.git
cd TokenTrackerZzH
node bin/tracker.js            # installs hooks, syncs, opens the dashboard
```

The dashboard is served locally at http://localhost:17890 . The Windows tray app is built from TokenTrackerWin/ — see MODIFICATIONS.md for the steps; it installs alongside the original (%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\TokenTrackerZzH).

Not on npm. npx tokentracker-cli installs upstream's package, not this build. Use the repository (or a release asset) instead.

---

## Sync is optional

Signing in is entirely optional — without an account everything is local-only, exactly like upstream.

**Sent when signed in:** hourly usage buckets — `hour_start`, `source`, `model`, the five token columns, `total_tokens`, `conversation_count` — plus a machine id at device-registration time.

**Never sent:** prompts, responses, file contents, project or repository names, file paths, and any provider credential. Per-project and per-session files (`project.queue.jsonl`, `session.queue.jsonl`) are never uploaded.

### Third-party services this build still talks to

Nothing here is upstream's infrastructure:

| Service | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| The AI providers' own APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cursor, Google, GitHub Copilot, xAI, Kimi, Z.ai, Qoder, Devin, CommandCode, iFlytek, TRAE) | While quota bars are visible | Reads *your* quota with credentials already on your machine. Direct from your machine to the provider; no middleman |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` | At most once a day | The public LiteLLM price table (one-way download) |
| `api.github.com` | On dashboard load | Star count for this repository |
| `codex-pets.net` | Only when you import a pet | The pet id you chose |
| `open.er-api.com` | Only if you pick a non-USD currency | Nothing but the request |
| `ip.net.coffee`, `claude.ai`, `1.1.1.1` | Only on the IP Check page | Your IP is the point of that page |
| Provider status pages | Only on the Service Status page | Nothing but the request |
| `fonts.googleapis.com` | Only when generating a share image | Standard web-font request |

There is **no analytics service**: the PostHog key is empty, and the anonymous install heartbeat now reports to my own server (disable it with `TOKENTRACKER_NO_TELEMETRY=1`).
